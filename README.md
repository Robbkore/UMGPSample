# ðŸ’¥ Code Sample Submission ðŸ’¥

Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to review my code sample submission.

## âœ” Setup

The bundle is inside the Pimcore skeleton project (original readme: PIMCORE.md). I used the docker-compose.yml file from the skeleton.  

For extra reference see the files in /pimcore-extra. I've added the class definition for the 
Product class, as well as an export of the products I created and used to test integration. 
There is also an export from the shopify developer storefront in the folder, purely for reference.

I used env.dev.local to store my secrets, so they are not in the commit history anywhere, 
cp env.dev.local.sample to env.dev.local and change the values to work.

## âœ” Usage

Once you add a new product through the Pimcore admin tool, the listener should either create 
or update an existing product, if it's published.

## âœ” Running the tests

I've added a few tests to the project, to run them, run the following command from the root:

```
php vendor/bin/phpunit bundles/Robbkore/ProductExporterBundle/tests
```

I did not load the tests in to the configuration since I was running them through PHPStorm.
